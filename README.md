# ArduLED 

### This project is work in progress, expect errors and mistakes

Welcome, to the ArduLED project. What is this? you may ask, this is a program, both one for an Arduino and one for a computer, together makes it posable to control Neopixels. It features easy-to-do setup, that does not require much work. A full list of features can be made:
 
 - Supports up to 8 LED strips with a total of 128 LEDs (on a standard Arduino with 2kb of memory)
 - Dynamic setup from the computer, there is no need to change the code for the Arduino if changes to your setup are made
 - BASS.NET powered visualizer, with a lot of diffrent options
 - Fading colors
 - Instructions mode, setup a set of instructions that the LED will follow
 - Very easy use
 - Supports multiple languages

And this is only the main topics of what ArduLED can do. There is still a lot of smaller features, however those are for you to find :)

This project is open source, so all the Visual Studio files comes with the project. From there on, you can either just use the program itself, or look into how its made.

Please do take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/kris701/ArduLED/wiki) too see how the program works and how to set it up.
